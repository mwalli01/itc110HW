21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Nakamoto?

A: [A-Z]\w+ Nakamoto

------------------------------------------

Regex version of strip()

A:

import re
sentence = '   hairymary had a littlehairy    '
def stripping(from_this, *args):
    n = re.compile(r'^[' + str(args) +' ]+|[' + str(args) +' ]+$')
    return n.sub('', from_this)
stripping(sentence, 'iahry')
