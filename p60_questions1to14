1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them? 
A: True and False, with capital F and T

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
A: and, or, not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator 
  A: 
  True and False = False
  True and True = True
  False and True = False
  False and False = False
  
  True or False = True
  False or True = True
  False or False = False
  True or True = True
  
  not True = False
  not False = True
  
  
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) A:False 
not (5 > 4) A:False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) A:True 
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) A:False 
(True and True) and (True == False) A:False 
(not False) or (not True) A:True

5. What are the six comparison operators? 
  A: 
  ==
  !=
  >
  <
  <=
  >=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator? 
   A:
    == compares two values and returns true if they are the same
    = assigns a value to a variable


7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
  A:
  A condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.
  You would use a condition in a flow control statement to decide what to do based on whether a condition is True or False

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0 
if spam == 10:    
  print('eggs') <------ first block    
  if spam > 5:        
    print('bacon') <------ second block    
  else:        
    print('ham') <------ third block
  print('spam') 
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints 
Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam. 
A:
print('Press 1 or 2 or whatever')
spam = input()
if spam == '1':
    print('Hello')
elif spam == '2':
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings')

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop? 
A: Control + C
